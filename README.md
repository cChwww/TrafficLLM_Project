The 18th China College Student Computer Design Competition in 2025

Work: A Digital Intelligent Traffic Assistant Driven by TrafficLLM Multimodal Large Model《基于TrafficLLM多模态大模型驱动的数智交通助手》
Track: Big Data Applications (Big Data Practice Competition)
Introduction to the work: Our team has developed a data-driven traffic assistant based on TrafficLLM multimodal large model, and ingeniously created a multi-source, multimodal, multi-dimensional, multi-scale, and multi module road condition comprehensive recognition and question answering system. Aim to fill the gaps in traditional transportation services, provide abnormal analysis and regulatory consulting services for transportation management departments, facility maintenance personnel, and the general public, build an intelligent and humane transportation service system, and achieve efficient daily travel and traffic management.

The content included in this project:
1. Some unique datasets used by the team to train the TrafficLLM multimodal large model include processed JSON files and unprocessed source files, which will be continuously updated.
2. The team provides evaluation results for TrafficLLM and other mainstream models.
3. The team provides MD files with two interfaces. If you need to use them, please contact our team.
